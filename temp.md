Another shiny point of graph database is the index-free adjacency property of native graphs. 
Each vertex stores its neighbour vertices information, hence, there is no of global indexing to referencing each vertex. When data size scales up, the native graph maintains constant performance since traversing a give vertex's neighbour nodes via edges will only load and touch the related data.

To make use of geographical data, another node location is added to previous recommender system. Accordingly, new edge location-business link is added. With location information, we now can make a more geographically related recommendation for user. For example, what Chinese restaurants do my friends like in Bugis? Another promising idea for personalised recommender is adding customer real-time location data, such as GPS data. This will empower a real-time
