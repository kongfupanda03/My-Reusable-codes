Another shiny point of graph database is the index-free adjacency property of native graphs. 
Each vertex stores its neighbour vertices information, hence, there is no of global indexing to referencing each vertex. When data size scales up, the native graph maintains constant performance since traversing a give vertex's neighbour nodes via edges will only load and touch the related data.
